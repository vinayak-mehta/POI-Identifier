## Person of Interest Identifier based on the Enron Corpus

The Enron Corpus is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation and acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company's collapse. The corpus is "unique" in that it is one of the only publicly available mass collections of "real" emails easily available for study, as such collections are typically bound by numerous privacy and legal restrictions which render them prohibitively difficult to access. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/). [about 423Mb, compressed]

You would also need the index of `from` and `to` emails. [128Mb]

svn export https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects/trunk/final\_project/emails\_by\_address

Currently, I've processed only the `from` emails which gives me an accuracy of 86%.

Dependencies for this project include: `nltk`, `numpy` and `scikit-learn`.
